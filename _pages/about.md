I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland and a member of CLIP. My advisors are Philip Resnik and Doug Oard. I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, and my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University.

I work on natural language processing (NLP) and its application to the broader healthcare problem: including automatic medical coding using clinical notes and suicide assessment using online postings. Currently, my focus is on using NLP to assist clinical experts to prioritize risk assessment of suicidality.
