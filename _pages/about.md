I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland and a member of [CLIP](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page). My advisors are [Philip Resnik](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/) and [Doug Oard](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~oard/). I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, and my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University.

I work on natural language processing (NLP) and its application to the broader healthcare problem: automatic medical coding using clinical notes and suicide assessment using online postings. Currently, my focus is on using NLP to assist clinical experts to prioritize risk assessment of suicidality.
